# MSphere_Update

Problem: Manually updating our brand new company database is extremely time consuming.  +2000 availabilities per city and sometimes
more than +10 fields to fill in its an extremely complicated process and with a limited number of analysts is almost imposible.

Problem 2: The database is so complex to maintain that without continued updates it becomes unusable

Solution: Use Selenium to automate our browser erase the original database and updated with our current spreadsheet!

Disclaimer: I have erased all sensible data including passwords, databases to avoid comprimising private information.
